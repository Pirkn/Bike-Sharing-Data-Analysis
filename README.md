# Bike Sharing Analysis: Understanding User Behavior

## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the Bike Sharing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project aims to understand the behavioral patterns of bike-sharing users by examining various factors like working days, weekdays, and weather conditions.

## Dataset
The dataset is available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Features Analyzed
- Time-series analysis of total bike rentals
- Casual vs. Registered users over time
- Correlation between weather conditions and bike rentals
- Impact of working days on casual and registered rentals

## Visualizations
- Line plots for time-series data
- Scatter plots to explore correlations
- Bar graphs for average rentals based on working days and weekdays

## Observations and Insights
- Casual rentals are significantly higher on non-working days compared to working days.
- Registered rentals are more consistent and possibly indicate daily commuting.
- Weather conditions like wind speed show a correlation with the number of bikes rented.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
